        "\n",
        "Using Python I am going to break down the Binary Search Algorithm using two approaches: Loop Iteration and Recursion. Binary Search is an algorithm that was designed as an efficient way to search for an object in a sorted set, often referred to as an array in coding. According to research the concept behind the Binary Search algorithm has been around for hundreds of years. The Jataka collections, which were written between 300 BC and 400 AD, described it similar to the recursion method.\n",

        "> \"So in time it came to pass that the people fell into a wretched plight. Reflecting that such had not been their lot in former days, but that now they were going to rack and ruin, they concluded that there must be some breeder of misfortune among them, and resolved to divide into two bands. This they did; and there were then two bands of five hundred families each. Thence-forward, ruin dogged the band which included the parents of the future Losaka, whilst the other five hundred families throve apace. So the former resolved to go on halving their numbers, and did so, until this one family was parted from all the rest.\"\n",

        "Binary Search is the computer form of that logic, divide and conquer! Essentially, if we know the elements of a list are arranged in a certain way, then we can quicken the time it takes to search by taking a comparrison of what we are looking for and the middle of a list. This allows us to decide where to search next - either in the left half or the right half of the list. We can then keep doing this until we find our mark!\n",
        "\n",
        "Why use this over a normal linear search?\n",
        "Well... say we have a list of numbers from 1 to 1,000,000. If we have to start from 1 and we are looking for 1,000,000 then we have to search every single element of this list. With Divide and Conquer, we are constantly skipping a head huge chunks of the array.\n",
        "\n",
        "Now when we talk about how long it takes for the algorithm to run, thats where we really see the advantages. While a standard linear search has a worst case running time of Θ(n) complexity to locate an element, Binary Search optimizes this to Θ(logn). (If Time Complexity is new to you, please read this: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/understanding-time-complexity-simple-examples/)\n",
